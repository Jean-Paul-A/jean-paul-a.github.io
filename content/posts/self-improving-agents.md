Self-improving agents are AI systems capable of autonomously modifying their own
objectives, policies, or architectures to enhance performance over time — a core
challenge at the frontier of reinforcement learning and meta-learning research.

Unlike static models, these agents close the loop between acting in an environment
and updating their own learning algorithm, raising both exciting possibilities and
fundamental questions about alignment and controllability.
